      <p>In Swamp Thing #52, Alan Moore established that Gotham City was founded in 1635 by Captain Jon Logerquist.
        Other writers have generally followed this backstory for Gotham City. According to the regular version of this
        story, Jon Logerquist was a Swedish mercenary who served the Swedish Empire during the Thirty Years' War and
        fought in the Battle of Nördlingen in Swabia. In order to flee the religious wars that were raging throughout
        Europe, Logerquist and a small group of colonists decided to pursue a new life in North America, where they
        established a settlement on the East Coast in 1635. Captain Logerquist named the territory Fort Adolphus after
        Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus, who had died in the Battle of Lützen a few years earlier.
        Many storylines have added more events to Gotham's history, and at the same time affecting the city and its
        people greatly. Perhaps the greatest in impact was a long set of serial storylines, which started with Ra's Al
        Ghul releasing a debilitating virus called the "Clench" during the "Contagion" storyline. As that arc wrapped
        the city was beginning to recover only to suffer an earthquake described as being 7.6 on the Richter Scale in
        "Cataclysm".<br /> <br />
