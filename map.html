          <p>In Swamp Thing #52, Alan Moore established that Gotham City was founded in 1635 by Captain Jon Logerquist. Other writers have generally followed this backstory for Gotham City. According to the regular version of this story, Jon Logerquist was a Swedish mercenary who served the Swedish Empire during the Thirty Years' War and fought in the Battle of Nördlingen in Swabia. In order to flee the religious wars that were raging throughout Europe, Logerquist and a small group of colonists decided to pursue a new life in North America, where they established a settlement on the East Coast in 1635. Captain Logerquist named the territory Fort Adolphus after Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus, who had died in the Battle of Lützen a few years earlier.

Fort Adolphus along with New Netherland was later ceded to the British in 1674 and English General Adam Howe took over as governor. Howe then renamed the settlement Gotham City. To an extent, this mirrors the history of many American cities that changed hands over the course of time. During the American Revolutionary War, Gotham City was the site of a major battle and rumors held it to be the site of various occult rites.
Shadowpact #5 by Bill Willingham expands upon Gotham's occult heritage by depicting a being who has slept for 40,000 years beneath the land upon which Gotham City was built. Strega, the being's servant, says that the "dark and often cursed character" of the city was influenced by the being who now uses the name "Doctor Gotham."
Many storylines have added more events to Gotham's history, and at the same time affecting the city and its people greatly. Perhaps the greatest in impact was a long set of serial storylines, which started with Ra's Al Ghul releasing a debilitating virus called the "Clench" during the "Contagion" storyline. As that arc wrapped the city was beginning to recover only to suffer an earthquake described as being 7.6 on the Richter Scale in "Cataclysm".<br/> <br/>
